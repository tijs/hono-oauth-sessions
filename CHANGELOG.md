## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-05

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed token refresh logic in `validateSession` method - now properly refreshes expired tokens automatically during session validation
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed mobile token refresh endpoint to use OAuth client's `refresh()` method instead of incorrectly trying to call methods on stored data objects
- **CRITICAL**: Removed problematic fallback behavior in mobile token refresh that bypassed actual token refresh when failures occurred

- Mobile token refresh failures now properly fail instead of silently returning stale tokens
- Improved error handling and logging for token refresh operations
